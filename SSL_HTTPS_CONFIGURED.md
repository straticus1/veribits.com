- ✅ **TLS Policy:** ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06
- ✅ **Protocols:** TLS 1.3, TLS 1.2
- ✅ **Forwards to:** ECS tasks via target group

### HTTP Redirect (Port 80)
- ✅ **Redirect Type:** 301 Permanent Redirect
- ✅ **Target:** HTTPS port 443
- ✅ **Applies to:** Both veribits.com and www.veribits.com

## 🧪 Testing:

### Test HTTP → HTTPS Redirect:

```bash
# Test redirect for veribits.com
curl -I http://veribits-alb-1472450181.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

# Expected: HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# Location: https://veribits-alb-1472450181.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:443/
```

### Test HTTPS Endpoint:

```bash
# Test HTTPS (after DNS propagates)
curl -I https://veribits.com

# Expected: HTTP/2 200
```

### Test in Browser:

1. **Before DNS propagates (now):**
   - http://veribits-alb-1472450181.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
   - Should redirect to HTTPS (may show certificate warning since using ALB DNS)

2. **After DNS propagates (24-48 hours):**
   - http://veribits.com → redirects to https://veribits.com ✓
   - http://www.veribits.com → redirects to https://www.veribits.com ✓
   - https://veribits.com → works directly ✓
   - https://www.veribits.com → works directly ✓

## 🔐 Security Features:

### TLS 1.3 Enabled
- Modern encryption standards
- Forward secrecy
- Improved performance

### Strong Cipher Suites
The `ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06` policy includes:
- TLS 1.3 ciphers (preferred)
- TLS 1.2 ciphers (fallback)
- No weak ciphers (RC4, DES, MD5 disabled)

### Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
- All cipher suites support PFS
- Session keys cannot be compromised even if private key is compromised

### HSTS Recommended
Add this to your API responses:
```php
header('Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload');
```

**View in AWS Console:**
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1#/certificates/1b11e755-3db4-4104-9f22-e4b980bd57e5
```

**Certificate Properties:**
- Domain: veribits.com
- Subject Alternative Names: www.veribits.com
- Key Algorithm: RSA-2048
- Signature Algorithm: SHA-256

## 📝 DNS Records Added:

Two CNAME records were automatically added for certificate validation:
```
_09598114b6bbe2e716eee622a6dd8e27.veribits.com     CNAME
_111befe0420260d4f2f265c1af78af9c.www.veribits.com CNAME
```

These records prove domain ownership to AWS Certificate Manager.
