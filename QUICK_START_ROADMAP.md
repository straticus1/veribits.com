## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Too ambitious, can't build 100 tools
**Mitigation**:
- Phase 1: 30 tools (achievable in 3 months with 5 engineers)
- Leverage OSS (Trivy, Checkov, Syft)
- Hire aggressively
- Focus on high-impact tools first

### Risk: Competitors copy us
**Mitigation**:
- Move fast, establish lead
- Build community moat (OSS, content)
- Unique AI features hard to replicate
- Strong integrations create lock-in

### Risk: Market not ready
**Mitigation**:
- Research shows tool fragmentation is #1 pain
- Start with proven high-demand tools
- Close customer feedback loops
- Iterate quickly
