- **API latency**: p95 < 200ms, p99 < 500ms
- **Scan throughput**: 100,000+ scans/day
- **Storage**: Petabyte-scale scan history

#### Optimization Strategies
1. **Smart Caching**
   - Cache scan results by content hash
   - If Docker image hasn't changed, return cached results
   - Cache CVE data (update hourly)

2. **Parallel Scanning**
   - Scan different layers simultaneously
   - Run multiple check types in parallel
   - Distribute scans across worker fleet

3. **Progressive Results**
   - Stream results as they're found
   - Don't wait for entire scan to complete
   - WebSocket or SSE for real-time updates

4. **Database Optimization**
   - Partition scan results by date
   - Index on frequently queried fields
   - Archive old scans to cold storage

5. **CDN & Edge Computing**
   - Edge caching for scan results
   - Regional scan workers
   - Global load balancing

---

### Security Considerations

#### Securing the Security Platform
1. **Input Validation**
   - Strict validation of all uploads
   - Sandbox untrusted code/configs
   - Rate limiting per user/IP

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt scan results at rest (AES-256)
   - Encrypt in transit (TLS 1.3)
   - Automatic PII detection and redaction

3. **Access Control**
   - RBAC for all resources
   - API key rotation
   - Audit logging for all actions

4. **Compliance**

- Leverage existing OSS tools (Trivy, Checkov, etc.)
- Hire aggressively (10+ engineers)
- Focus on core value first, add breadth later

#### 2. Competition Risk
**Risk**: Snyk or others copy our comprehensive approach

**Mitigation:**
- Move fast, establish market lead
- Build community moat (OSS, content, brand)
- Unique features (AI, collaboration) hard to copy
- Strong integrations create switching costs

#### 3. Technical Risk
**Risk**: Performance/scale issues with 100+ tools

**Mitigation:**
- Microservices architecture
- Kubernetes for auto-scaling
- Extensive caching
- Load testing from day 1
- Monitoring and observability

#### 4. Monetization Risk
**Risk**: Developers reluctant to pay, prefer free tools

**Mitigation:**
- Generous free tier (50 scans/month)
- Clear value prop for paid (team features, history, automation)
- PLG → sales for scale-ups/enterprises
- Usage-based pricing aligns with value

#### 5. Market Risk
**Risk**: Market not ready for consolidated platform

**Mitigation:**
- Research shows tool fragmentation is major pain point
- Start with high-demand tools (containers, SBOM, API)
- Iterate based on usage data
- Close customer relationships (feedback loops)
